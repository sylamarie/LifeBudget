# LifeBudget
Financial stress is one of the most common problems faced by people worldwide. Many individuals live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to track spending, manage bills, save money, or understand where their income actually goes. Existing financial tools are often too complex, overwhelming, or designed only for financially literate users. 

 The purpose of LifeBudget is to provide a simple, human-friendly financial wellness platform that helps people understand their income, expenses, and spending habits without requiring accounting knowledge. The project focuses on clarity, accessibility, and emotional well-being rather than complex financial forecasting.
